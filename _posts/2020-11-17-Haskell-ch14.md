##### Ex1 from slides:   

##### Show how the Maybe type can be made foldable and traversable, by giving explicit definitions for fold, foldMap, foldr, foldl and traverse.  

##### Solution
```haskell
import Data.Foldable

data Maybe1 x = Just1 x | Nothing1

instance Semigroup a => Semigroup (Maybe1 a) where
    Nothing1 <> my = my
    mx <> Nothing1 = mx
    Just1 x <> Just1 y = Just1 (x <> y)

instance Monoid a => Monoid (Maybe1 a) where
    mempty = Nothing1

instance Foldable Maybe1 where
    --fold::Monoid a => Maybe1 a => a
    fold Nothing1 = mempty
    fold (Just1 x) = x

    -- foldMap :: Moniod b => (a->b) -> Maybe1 a -> b
    foldMap _ Nothing1 = mempty
    foldMap f (Just1 a) = f a

    -- foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> Maybe1 a -> b
    foldr _ v Nothing1 = v
    foldr f v (Just1 x) = f x v

    -- foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> Maybe1 b -> a
    foldl _ v Nothing1 = v
    foldl f v (Just1 x) = f v x

instance Functor Maybe1 where
    --fmap :: (a->b) -> Maybe1 a -> Maybe1 b
    fmap _ Nothing1 = Nothing1
    fmap f (Just1 x) = Just1 (f x)

instance Traversable Maybe1 where
    --traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b ) -> Maybe1 a -> f (Maybe1 b)
    traverse _ Nothing1 = pure Nothing1
    traverse f (Just1 x) = fmap Just1 (f x)
```

##### Ex 2 from slides

##### In a similar manner, show how the following type of binary trees with data in their nodes can be made into a foldable and traversable type:
```Haskell
data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) deriving Show
```
##### Solution
```haskell
import Data.Foldable 

data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) deriving Show
{-
instance Semigroup (Tree a) where
    -- mappend :: Tree a -> Tree a -> Tree a
    Leaf <> b = Node Leaf a b
    Node l a r <> Leaf = Node (Node l a r) a Leaf
怎么定义 Moniod Tree
-}

instance Foldable Tree where
    --fold :: Monoid a => Tree a -> a
    fold Leaf = mempty
    fold (Node l a r) = fold l <> a <> fold r

    --foldMap :: Moniod b => (a -> b) -> Tree a -> b
    foldMap _ Leaf = mempty
    foldMap f (Node l a r) = foldMap f l <> f a <> foldMap f r

    --foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> Tree a -> b
    foldr _ v Leaf = v
    foldr f v (Node l a r) = foldr f (f a (foldr f v r)) l

    --foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> Tree b -> b
    foldl _ v Leaf = v
    foldl f v (Node l a r) = foldl f (f (foldl f v l) a) r



instance Functor Tree where
    --fmap :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
    fmap _ Leaf = Leaf
    fmap f (Node l a r) = Node (fmap f l) (f a) (fmap f r)

instance Traversable Tree where
    -- traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Tree a -> f (Tree b)
    traverse _ Leaf = pure Leaf
    traverse f (Node l a r) = fmap Node (traverse f l) <*> f a <*> traverse f r
```

### 课本习题(Graham Hutton 2ed)

##### 1. Complete the following instance declaration from Data.Monoid to make a pair type into a monoid provided the two component types are monoids:
```Haskell
instance (Monoid a, Monoid b) => Monoid (a,b) where 
    -- mempty :: (a,b)
    mempty = ...
    -- mappend :: (a,b) -> (a,b) -> (a,b) 
    (x1,y1) ‘mappend‘ (x2,y2) = ...
```
   
##### 2. In a similar manner, show how a function type a result type b is a monoid.   

##### 3. Show how the Maybe type can be made foldable and traversable, by giving explicit definitions for *fold*, *foldMap*, *foldr*, *foldl* and *traverse*.  

##### 4.  In a similar manner, show how the following type of binary trees with data in their nodes can be made into a foldable and traversable type:
```Haskell
data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) 
    deriving Show
```

##### 5. Using foldMap, define a generic version of the higher-order function filter on lists that can be used with any foldable type:
```Haskell
filterF :: Foldable t => (a -> Bool) -> t a -> [a]
```
