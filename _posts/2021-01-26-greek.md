# Greek

## Lesson 1: Alphabet

Erasmus — restored classical pronunciation

Homer (800 BCE) — Classical attic (5 Century BCE) — common literary dialect (κοινὴ διάλεκτος) (standard after the conquest of Alexander the Great)

this course focuses on Homeric Greek first

**Breathing mark**:  **᾽**  rough breathing (with h) ;   ῾  smooth breathing (without h)

**Diphthongs**: two vowels sounded as one

**diaeresis**: ϊ  ( ι is pronounced seperately 

## Lesson 2: First-declension Nouns

endings on nouns and adjectives - declension

endings on verbs - conjugation

iota subscript:  ι \ ῃ

Ex: Βουλή (plan)

Eg2 : ἀρχή (beginning) ...  


## Lesson 3: Accent

invented by Aristophanes of Byzantium (Head of the great library at Alexandria)

acute: ´ (typing ; )

grave: ` (typing ] )

circumflex: ῀ (typing [ )

- originally a pitch accent, not a stress accent (rose with acute, fell with grave, rose and fell with circumflex)

Greek prose : treat accents as simple stress accents

Greek poetry : ignore accents entirely
    

Persistent accents: Accents are persistent (try to stay where they are if possible)

Recessive accents (verbs): try to go as far back from the end of the word as the rules of accentuation will permit (at most 3 syllables from the end)
    

Ultima / Penult / Antepenult
    

An acute may stand on any of the last syllables

A grave may stand only on the last syllable

An acute on the ultima turns into a frave, if followed by another word with no intervening mark of punctuation
    
    

Circumflexes can stand on either penult or ultima

A circumflex can stand on the ultima if the final vowel or diphthong is long

A circumflex can also stand on the penult if the second to last vowel is long and the final vowel is short
    

No accent can stand farther back from the end than the penult if the final syllable is long

Eg: ἑλώριον (booty or plunder)(acute on antepenult) ;   
    ἑλωρἰου (Gen. of the booty)(accent on penult because ultima "ου" is diphthong and all diphthongs are long)

Long syllables can carry either circumflex or acute

    

Nominatives and accusatives tend to use acutes on ultima whereas the genitive and dative tend to use circumflexes (βουλή / βουλῆς)


    
If a circumflexes appears on the penult, the ultima must be short

Eg: δοῦλος (slave) ; δούλου (of the slave)

    
Acutes and graves go after the brething mark: ὅς (typing / (smooth acute) + (smoth grave) - (smooth circumflex) and use shift for routh)

Circumflexes are placed above the breathing mark: ὧρα ἧρως

Put diacritical marks over the second vowel of the diphthong: οὔνεκα

For capital letters we place the marks in front of the vowel


    
When diacriticals stand over the first vowel of what should typically be a diphthong, the vowels are pronounced seperately: Ἅις, Ἄιδος

    
Proclitics: procline (ἐν χερσίν)

Enclitics: have accents, but habitually lose them to the words that precede them

(eg in English: The car is red → the car's red)

(eg in Greek: βουλὴ καλή ἐστι): last two words treated as one

## Lesson 4: Additional Patterns for First Declension

Rules of definite article

![Greek%20810d339140fd46c09863386ff9745501/Screen_Shot_2021-02-12_at_8.51.34_PM.png](/screenshots/Greek%20810d339140fd46c09863386ff9745501/Screen_Shot_2021-02-12_at_8.51.34_PM.png)

α sometimes appears in place of η in first declension

![Greek%20810d339140fd46c09863386ff9745501/Screen_Shot_2021-02-12_at_8.53.31_PM.png](/screenshots/Greek%20810d339140fd46c09863386ff9745501/Screen_Shot_2021-02-12_at_8.53.31_PM.png)

In glossary, all the nouns are listed first in nominative, Gen. Singular following, then definite article (ὁ masculine, ἡ feminine, τό neuter)
    

**Homeric plural endings:** αι, αων, ῃσι, ας

Koine pluarl genitive : αων → ων

Homeric dative plural (variations): ῃσι → ῃς → αις (in latter greek)

![Greek%20810d339140fd46c09863386ff9745501/Screen_Shot_2021-02-12_at_9.05.09_PM.png](/screenshots/Greek%20810d339140fd46c09863386ff9745501/Screen_Shot_2021-02-12_at_9.05.09_PM.png)

## Lesson 5: Verbs in the Present Tense

change ος ending to ε when calling out to someone (χαίρε, Μυλωνικέ)

    

Greek verbs can be described in terms of person, number, tense, mood, and voice

- Voice: active or passive (active for this lesson)
- Mood: indicative (for this lesson)- states facts; imperative - gives orders
- Tense: present (for this lesson)

deeper in person & number

![Greek%20810d339140fd46c09863386ff9745501/Screen_Shot_2021-02-12_at_9.22.05_PM.png](/screenshots/Greek%20810d339140fd46c09863386ff9745501/Screen_Shot_2021-02-12_at_9.22.05_PM.png)

To find a verb's base, remove the first person ending

Verb (first person present sigular form) in dictionary

    

Simple present: I stop

Present progressive: I am stopping (for questioning: am I stoping)

Emphatic present: I do stop (use it for questions: do I stop?)

All the same in Ancient Greek: παύω
